# Useful Links
Contains useful links that I've found to be useful for me and also for any newbie os developer like me during the journey of developing an os from scratch.

## Bootloader
### BIOS
- [int table](https://stanislavs.org/helppc/int_table.html) - contains "Intel Defined CPU Exception Table", "IBM PC Hardware Interrupt Table", "Interrupt Table as Implemented by System BIOS/DOS", and document pages for the interrupts. Pretty useful during BIOS bootloader development.
- [wiki.osdev.org](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) - contains a lot of tutorials, articles, forums, etc. about os development. 
- [x86 and amd64 instruction reference](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/) - derived from [Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual](https://software.intel.com/en-us/download/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-sdm-combined-volumes-1-2a-2b-2c-2d-3a-3b-3c-3d-and-4), not perfect, but helpful for quick instructions lookup.
