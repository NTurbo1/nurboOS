# Nurbo OS
I've started developing this OS as a personal project to learn operating system concepts, computer architecture, and assembly language. Since I'm very new to low level programming and stuff, it's gonna be very toy, useless, basic operating system. I'm planning to work on this project for several years and as I gain more knowledge and skills through the process of implementing my OS, I hope I can create an OS that can do something at least on a computer. Wish me luck :).

## The Philosophy behind the OS name...
// TODO

## Tools used for OS development
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) (for testing my OS)
- [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) (for the implementation of the kernel and most of the OS components)
- [NASM](https://www.nasm.us) (for bootloader)

## Architecture support
- x86
