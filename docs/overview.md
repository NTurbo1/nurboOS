# Nurbo OS
I've started developing this OS as a personal project to learn operating system concepts, computer architecture, and assembly language. Since I'm very new to low level programming and stuff, it's gonna be very toy, useless, basic operating system. I'm currently doing very basic things to at least boot up my os and load the kernel. However, I'm planning to work on this project for several years and as I gain more knowledge and skills through the process of implementing my OS, I hope I can create an OS that can do something at least on a computer. Wish me luck :).

## The Philosophy behind the OS name...
// TODO

## What can NurboOS do so far?
- Print a string and a hex value as a string onto the screen.
- Working on a simple disk loading functionality

## Tools used for OS development
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) (for testing my OS)
- [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) (for the implementation of the kernel and most of the OS components)
- [NASM](https://www.nasm.us) (for bootloader)

## Architecture support
- x86
